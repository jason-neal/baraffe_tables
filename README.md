# Baraffe tables.

Some scripts to use the [Baraffe et al. 2003](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003A%26A...402..701B)/[2015](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...577A..42B) to estimate BD parameters knowing some information...

BDmass_to_flux_ratio.py:
------------------------
Takes a companion mass (in Mjup) and uses this to look up the magnitude of the brown dwarf. This compares it to the magnitude of the star to calculate the flux ratio.


BDmass_to_flux_ratio.py:
------------------------
This tries to go back the opposite direction. Given the flux ratio what is the mass of the companion.
